# In this project, I played a key role in manipulating and analyzing data to predict the success of SpaceX landings. 

Using Python and Pandas, I conducted exploratory data 
analysis and leveraged SQL queries for data selection and sorting. The culmination of 
these efforts resulted in the development of a machine learning model, contributing to 
improved business functionality
